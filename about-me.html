                    <h2>Cultural Identity Through Intersectionality</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Hmong people through ethnicity and Culture have gone through a great dead of trauma and abuse.
                        Despite these challenges, many Hmong people have been working endlessly to gain back what they
                        have and what they have lost to reclaim and preserve their cultural heritage. I know this
                        because I am hmong. The struggles like the language, tradition, and the history shape who we are
                        as people and what we stand for. Some things like the centuries of migration and displacement
                        from origins within southern China to the mountains of Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and other
                        neighboring countries have made it difficult for Hmong people to maintain their cultural
                        traditions and identity.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The trama from the Vietnam war and the secret war brought displacement of the Hmong people. This
                        displacement brought about by the conflict has led to a loss of connection to their roots and
                        challenges in passing down traditions to future generations. This lead to younger generations to
                        struggle with who they are and where they come from. I am a prime example of this not even
                        knowing that I was hmong until I got to highschool. I felt disconnected and lost, searching for
                        a sense of identity and belonging. From the displacement came resettling in many different
                        places, these places consist of a various amounts of cultures and languages that further worked
                        into displacing Hmong people from our traditions and culture. Often these places were places of
                        war and from this war Hmong people were hunted and seen as the scum of the earth by various
                        asian groups. Often if Hmong people didn't adapt and forced to conform into these other asian
                        languages and cultures then you were often executed or ended up starving with no home to live in
                        or to go to. A whole race suddenly homeless and nationless. All because of the need to colonize.

                    <h2>Socioeconomical and Generational Gap </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The socioeconomic status of hmong people led to a difficult time after the vietnam war from
                        losing a nationality to losing a home to becoming a refuge. Many Hmong people faced challenges
                        adjusting to a new way of life in a foreign country, often experiencing discrimination and
                        poverty. And although I don't know it the best I do understand the struggles that comes with it
                        as being first generation isn't the easiest thing in the world to do especially when you see
                        your parents struggling to be able to do much of anything to just get you your education so you
                        can do better than them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Being a first generation Hmong person is interesting. I get to see the difference between the
                        newest generation aka me and the old generation that went through the war and immigrated to the
                        U.S. The generational gap is interesting as with it brings an interesting perspective on the
                        cultural changes and challenges faced by my family. One such gap that a lot of immigrant and
                        first generation families have is the language gap. Although I speak English it isn't my native
                        language and there was even a point in time where I would have to work towards translating
                        documents like medical documents or bills for my parents so they would be able to understand and
                        comprehend the significance of the scenario. One such bad time was having to tell my family what
                        the doctors were saying and having to tell my family drastic information.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Another difference is the tradition that the different generations bring. If you are the older
                        generation you were expected to go out at 15-16 and get a wife and make your own life and work
                        in the fields and provide for your family. But even sadder is as a woman you were expected to go
                        and get married at 14 and expected to have kids then but if you didn't there was a good chance
                        of you getting marital kidnapped where the husband goes and takes the wife from her family. But
                        the new generation especially the ones like me who live in the us is different. We expect to
                        live with our parents until we move out or until we get kicked out like how it is for Americans.
                        We expect to be treated like an American when our parents don't even know what its like to live
                        that life. Us as the newer generation work towards creating a future where we can support
                        ourselves and our families without relying on our parents. We work towards education to elevate
                        hmong people and ourselves to better standings. While the older generations work for survival
                        and for the future generations to do better than they did.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The mental health of immigrant generation brings astigmatism and a coping mechanism often
                        resulting from the war from immigrating from refugee camps and are often left untreated leading
                        to generational trama. While the newer generation often seek out mental health support from this
                        generational trama but often will end up experiencing the emotional stress from balancing
                        cultural expectations with personal aspirations.

                    <h2>Settler Colonialism</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Settler colonialism is more personal than not for me. From the cycle of displacement to erasure
                        of my people. This has been happening for generations upon generations. Beginnign with being
                        forced out of china, to surviving the war in Laos to surviving the Vietnam war and finally
                        arriving in the U.S. As refugees. Hmong people have been treated as expendable outsiders and
                        still are. Even the first time hmong people were represented was in 2023 when hmong people were
                        seen as veterans for fighting in the vietnam war that happened over half a century ago. The
                        Hmong people continue to face discrimination and marginalization in society. From beintg used in
                        the Secret War and then abandoned, forced to flee and begin again with nothing. Even here in
                        America, Hmong people are often invisible expected to conform while our history gets erased and
                        forgotten.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Growing up I always constantly felt pressured to succeed in a system that forces you down, a
                        system that doesn't want you there, a system that doesn't recognize where we came from. Hmong
                        people carry the trauma of war, colonization, and culture loss, while also attempting to
                        preserve who we are. For us Hmong people settler colonialism isn't just in the past it's
                        something we're still healing from now in this current age and day. Hmong people were controlled
                        for over a century from the French and the Chinese, and the Viets, and so much more and now we
                        just began healing and are expected to just forget about our past and conform to a world that
                        views us as expendables.
