                <h2>Model Minority and Housing Discrimination</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From week 10, especially the Thursday lecture about the model minority and the housing
                    discrimination and suburbanization, spoke to me. It shed light on the systemic inequalities faced by
                    Asian Americans and how these issues still persist today. As mentioned within class, the housing
                    discrimination was rough, as many people were funneled into low-quality, high-density developments
                    that perpetuated poverty and isolation. Surprisingly, it connected to me and reminded me of my
                    parents and how being hmong they were both immigrants and had to fight for any housing for our
                    family. From that experience I felt a drastic feeling of empathy and understanding for those who had
                    to go through the same or at least a similar experience. The model minority was interesting as the
                    whole US sees Asian people as a model of perfection to strive for but they ignore the mental health
                    issues that come with this expectation. I understand and have seen this model minority first hand
                    through my whole life not only from my parents but from the people around me leading me to not care
                    anymore about grades or about anything within life. I understand the pressure to conform to this
                    stereotype, but I have found it detrimental to my own well-being. Especially for those who are hmong
                    you are always seen and expected to be the next generation that builds and gets hmong people out
                    there to get hmong people known to the world that we are still here and that we aren't gone. This
                    mixture of being hmong and because hmong is asian is a strange and interesting point when talking
                    about a model minority because we are the minority because were asian but were the minority within
                    asians as well but along with that a lot of us are new generations being often second or third
                    generation if your lucky.

                <h2>Intersectionality </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From week 9 we learn about the intersectionality from the article "Why intersectionality can't wait"
                    by the Washington post written by Kimberle Crenshaw. This article emphasizes the importance of
                    recognizing the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, gender, and class. And
                    for me I felt this personally because as she told the stories of how women and girls of color are
                    left in the shadows of discrimination and segregation, I reflected on my own experiences along with
                    my parents experiences and my other extended family. From her article we learn about how people of
                    color especially women because their specific intersectionality lead them to being overlooked and
                    underrepresented in various aspects of society. Though not me personally to understand this but my
                    uncles who are in their 60 - 70's have experienced discrimination like this. My uncles who were all
                    a part of the secret war being drafted when they were super young and still learning how to be an
                    adult had to begin to fight in the war and only ended up being awarded as veterans as late as
                    December of 2023. This is something that I feel is important because their specific
                    intersectionality of them being young adult males who were hmong and were used by the U.S while
                    living in villages suddenly changed to being armed and fighting for their children and wives or even
                    just their parents and family. It is a unique perspective that sheds light on how late it took for
                    these marginalized voices to be heard. It took being colonized being in a war at the age of 15 it
                    took being an immigrant, a refugee, and a survivor to finally become recognized for the effort they
                    put into the war.

                    <h2>Settler Colonialism</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As I remember within class discussions, the impact of settler colonialism on indigenous communities was often overlooked. The narrative of resistance and survival among marginalized groups like the Hmong people adds a crucial layer to our understanding of history and power dynamics. Recognizing the experiences of those who have been marginalized and oppressed allows for a more comprehensive and accurate portrayal of history. By acknowledging the struggles and resilience of these communities, we can begin to dismantle the systems that perpetuate inequality and injustice. I don't want a world that my parents had to go through to happen to everyone. The colonization of hmong people from the Chinese to then the colonization from the Laos to the Vietnamese to the burmese to French to the U.S. To the continuing cycle of colonization from everyone. These struggles led to the hmong people almost losing who we are and to us almost losing our whole cultural identity. It is important to recognize and honor the cultural heritage and identity of marginalized communities, such as the Hmong people, in order to prevent further erasure of their history. By learning from the past, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable future for all individuals.
