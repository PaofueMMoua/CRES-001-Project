                    The Hmong intersectionality, from my experience, has happened as I begin to grow and understand the world more. From the intersectionality of being Hmong and being a young male , I have learned to navigate and advocate for myself in spaces that may not always value or understand my identity. Growing up I struggled through discrimination and stereotypes that have shaped my perspective on the importance of representation and diversity in all areas of life. Especially when compared to the struggles of preserving my cultural identity while within a highly dominant American culture.
